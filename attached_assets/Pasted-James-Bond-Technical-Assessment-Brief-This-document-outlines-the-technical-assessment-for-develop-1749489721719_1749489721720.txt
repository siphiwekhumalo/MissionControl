James Bond Technical Assessment Brief

This document outlines the technical assessment for developers interested in joining our
team. Candidates are expected to build a simple web application using a frontend and
backend of their choice.

Test Concept: James Bond Ping Mission

James Bond must send out a ping via a secure web application. These pings represent
messages with coordinate data and can only be viewed by the user who sent them and
administrators. James may respond to an existing ping with another, forming a trail of
related pings.

Technical Requirements

Frontend
The frontend must consist of three pages:
1. 1. Dashboard Page
 - Displays a navigation section
- Shows the latest three pings from the logged-in user
- Includes links to the &quot;Send Ping&quot; and &quot;All Pings&quot; pages
2. 2. Send Ping Page
 - Contains a button to send a new ping
- Each ping includes random coordinates (latitude and longitude)
- Allows optional response to the most previous ping only (create a ping trail)
3. 3. All Pings Page
 - Displays a table of all pings sent by the logged-in user
- Each entry should include coordinates, timestamp, and parent ping (if any)

Backend

The backend must include:
 Authentication
 - Users must be able to sign up and log in securely
- JWT or session-based auth accepted
 Ping API
 - POST /pings: Create a new ping
- GET /pings: Get all pings for the logged-in user
- GET /pings/latest: Retrieve the latest three pings
- POST /pings/:id: Respond to a specific ping (trail creation)
Only authenticated users should be able to access ping-related routes.

Submission Instructions

- Please upload your code to a public or private Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.).
- Share the repository link or download in your submission.
- Ensure the README includes clear setup instructions for both frontend and backend.

Evaluation Criteria

- Code clarity and structure
- Proper separation of concerns
- Authentication implementation
- Correct usage of API endpoints
- UX and flow of the frontend
